# Problem 12: Highly divisible triangular number

The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the __7__<sup>th</sup> triangle number would be __1__ + __2__ + __3__ + __4__ + __5__ + __6__ + __7__ = __28__. The first ten terms would be:

__1__, __3__, __6__, __10__, __15__, __21__, __28__, __36__, __45__, __55__, __...__

Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:

    1 : 1
    3 : 1, 3
    6 : 1, 2, 3, 6
    10: 1, 2, 5, 10
    15: 1, 3, 5, 15
    21: 1, 3, 7, 21
    28: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28

We can see that __28__ is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.

What is the value of the first triangle number to have over _N_ divisors?
